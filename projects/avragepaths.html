                        aVRage Paths was developed to address a key challenge in VR locomotion research:
                        the difficulty of creating environments that are both consistent and random.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To study different locomotion methods (e.g., teleportation, arm swinging),
                        researchers want to better isolate the effects of the locomotion method by
                        placing participants in randomized environments.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The go-to for this has always been randomly generated mazes - but with
                        that random generation can lead to variance across participants. One subject
                        may get a fairly easy maze while another gets a complicated maze by pure unluckiness.
                        This makes it hard to isolate the locomotion method as a result.

                        Our solution to this problem was to generate the maze around the player "on the fly."
                        The path that a participant takes is defined by the researcher prior to the
                        participant starting the maze, and no matter which way the participant goes,
                        the path remains the same.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This approach introduces a unique concept we call "impossible spaces."
                        The maze may have paths that overlap physically, but not logically.
                        I can take four right turns and physically end up where I started,
                        but to get back to the start of my path, I would have to undo those four turns.

                        Below is an example of what maze traversal could look like from a top-down perspective.

                        My role focused on implementing the locomotion systems, and the system that allows
                        researchers to swap in their own locomotion system that they want to study.
                        I also aided in creating textures and prefabs throughout the project.
